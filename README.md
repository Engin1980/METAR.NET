METAR.NET is class library for .NET FW 3.5 used to decode and encode weather information METAR, TAF or SPECI reports used to capture and present weather mostly for aviation.
There has been recently added implementation for Silverlight 3, you will find it in the downloads section.

EDIT --- Version 2.0 RC2 (29. 6. 2011) ! ! ! New version of METAR.NET decoder now supports METAR, SPECI and TAF reports. However, this version is completely rewritten and is fully incompatible with the previous 1.* versions. There are new namespaces, new data type names, e.t.c. The content is now divided into multiple dll files - one with main data types, another supporting downloading, decoding and formattings of the decoded metar/speci/taf reports. However, new specification of METAR reports including NIL, AMD, COR, NCD,... codes is supported.
